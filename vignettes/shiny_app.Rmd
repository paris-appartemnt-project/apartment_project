## Overview:

This function is used in order for the user to find his optimal dream flat inside of Paris. It is the user friendly app used to implement the functions which were defined in the apartment.paris R package. Therefore, the user will use the shiny app to input his own preferences for the code, which will automatically update every time he interacts with the command panel. An app is outputted in order to visualise the location in Paris of the flats which best fit criteria which have been selected. Finally, a table is outputted with all the characteristics of the flats which fit the users needs, and a clickable link to their webpage descriptions. All of the values used in the shiny were used from dataframes which were scrapped and cleaned on the web.
